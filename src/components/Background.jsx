        Hi there! I'm Mar√≠a, a retail pro who's transitioned from team
        management and makeup brushes to the exciting world of technology. Over
        the years, I've improved my skills in communication, adaptability, and
        problem-solving. When I'm not navigating the tech landscape, you'll find
        me exploring new worlds through books and horror movies... Or playing
        with my cats. Ready for a good time and a productive journey together!
      </p>
